    "description": "Bag of Puppies Wondrous Item, Very Rare This charming bag is actually an extradimensional puppy paradise. Its interior is a divinely designed dog resort that can comfortably house a thousand puppies. The puppies live in luxury. The bag provides them with as much air, food, and drink as they need while keeping them young for as long as they stay in. When found, a Bag of Puppies will typically hold about a thousand puppies. Unlike lesser bags, the Bag of Puppies is indestructible. Pick a Puppy. As an action, you can reach inside the bag and pick a puppy. Alternatively, you can use your action to place a puppy in the bag. Canine Flood. As an action, you can turn the bag inside out, releasing all thousand puppies in a 30-foot-radius sphere of puppies. This canine flood persists for one round as puppies tumble and fall, heavily obscuring the area. The ground in a 30-foot-radius circle becomes difficult terrain as puppies scurry about. Any Medium or smaller creature that enters the circle for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there must succeed on a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (the creature chooses the ability to use and may willingly fail the save) or fall prone and become grappled (escape DC 15) as enthusiastic and playful puppies jump onto it. The circle lasts for 3d6 rounds, until the puppies get tired from all the play. Gamemaster Tip: Invulnerable Puppies You can use the Bag of Puppies to create exciting plot hooks for your players, but certain adventure themes might put a thousand puppies in danger. If you are playing with younger players, or if some of your players are uncomfortable with puppies being in danger, consider making the puppies immune to all damage and conditions. Optional Rule: Moving Through Puppies At the gamemaster\u2019s discretion, moving through the puppy-covered area left behind the Canine Flood has the following complications. If you move more than 5 feet through the puppy-covered area in your turn, for each additional 5 feet moved there is a cumulative 20 percent chance you will harm 1d6 puppies. You may choose to ignore the difficult terrain restriction altogether and trample through the puppies. For every 5 feet you move through the puppy-covered area, you automatically harm 1d6 puppies. If you finish your movement inside the puppy-covered area, you must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone, harming an additional 1d6 puppies. Optional Rule: Karmic Puppies At the gamemaster\u2019s discretion, the bag might punish those who seek to harm the puppies that reside in it with great misfortune. For every puppy you willingly harm or kill, you gain 1 Misfortune point. The gamemaster can spend 1 Misfortune point at any time to give your character disadvantage (or to cancel advantage) on a roll. The puppies you harm or kill must consider the bag their home for this effect to take place. Optional Rule: Dire Wolf Trouble At the gamemaster\u2019s discretion, the bag might transform puppies into mighty celestial dire wolves to punish those who harmed them. Every puppy you willingly harm or kill immediately transforms into an adult Dire Wolf (CR 1) that attacks you. The Dire Wolf is celestial instead of beast and ascends to a different plane of existence when either you or it dies. The puppies you harm or kill must consider the bag their home for this effect to take place. Optional Rule: Canine Fate At the gamemaster\u2019s discretion, the bag might punish those who seek to harm the puppies that reside in it by turning them into puppies. For every puppy you willingly harm or kill, there is a cumulative 1 percent chance that you are permanently transformed into an ordinary puppy. Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of a Puppy (CR 0), but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. Your gear melds into your new form and you can\u2019t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from it. Only a wish spell or divine intervention can reverse this transformation.

This place is safe enough, and we won\u2019t be disturbed. Let\u2019s release them, but on the condition that you will be the one to put them back into the bag.\u201d She hands the bag to you, but before she pulls her hands away, she adds: \u201cUnderstand that people are weird, so if you end up taking this bag and the young dogs in it, please keep it away from those who would abuse it and make sure that no tricksters polymorphed into dogs try to sneak into the bag.

Roll 10d8; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can affect.

    "name": "Seed Satchel",
    "description": "Wondrous item, Hag, Rare (attunement) Using a seed satchel is an evil act. Hags rarely make these for others because they are made from hag hide. When given to others, a seed satchel is usually made out of the hide of a rival hag that was disposed of by the recipient. Seed satchels are dull green or brown hide bags and are often covered with various bodily fluid stains. Seed satchels often contain other oddities besides seeds or teeth. It takes a hag 1d3 years to make a seed satchel. The seeds themselves have to be the teeth of children of any sentient species. Hags can only use the teeth of children that have been digested in some way, with the teeth collected after they pass. Seed satchels usually contain 9 (1d6 + 6) teeth or \"seeds,\" but can easily hold more depending on the hag\u2019s ability to find children. Seeds can be used to do the following: Create Skeletal Wyvern. The user buries a seed in mud, swamp, brackish water, or very damp earth and in 1d10 minutes, a skeletal wyvern will burst from the seed. The wyvern will serve the bearer of the seed satchel until destroyed, at which point one of the skeletal wyvern\u2019s teeth will be a recoverable seed for use in the satchel. The user can only have one skeletal wyvern at a time. Hex. As an action, the user throws a seed, Ranged Weapon Attack + (their ranged weapon attack or spell attack modifier), range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 1 bludgeoning damage. If the seed hits the target, then that target is affected by a 3rd spell-level hex. The user does not need to concentrate to maintain this hex, and can attempt to hex a different target with a seed per round. Each hex effect lasts for 10 minutes. Seed Snaps. A seed can be eaten as a bonus action, but in order to have effect the teeth must be chewed up before swallowed. A creature can chew three seeds at once. The person eating the seeds will taste thick sweet citrus juice and will be healed for 6 (1d4 + 4) hit points per seed eaten. Every three seeds eaten also removes one exhaustion level. All creatures within 10 feet of the eater, except for the eater, hear high pitched screams of panicked children. They must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or gain the frightened condition for one round. Once a target succeeds at this save they are immune to this effect for the next 24 hours. This may cause horror or madness depending on the DM. Spawn Tree. The user can bury a seed and a tree will grow quickly over the course of 3d4 hours into a mature tree roughly 40 feet tall. After 2d4 days the tree will no longer be detected as magical and becomes a random fruit bearing tree. But after 10 years this tree will begin to bear fruit, and 1 in 20 of its fruit have a small child\u2019s tooth imbedded inside. This tooth can be used as a seed for a seed satchel. These trees are not immortal but are highly resistant to non-magical poison or disease. Most evil druids will gladly use up an entire seed satchel to plant these very sturdy trees. Wall of Thorns. The user throws a seed up to 60 feet away as an action. At the beginning of the user\u2019s next round a wall of thorns will spring into existence, per spell, with a spell DC 15. This wall will last an hour and then die, leaving behind a brittle rotten wall of thorns that does no damage and is easily hacked through. No seeds are recovered from this use. Hag Use of a Seed Satchel There are few hag gifts more powerful than a seed satchel in the hands of a hag. A hag can use a seed to do all of the functions listed previously, and the following: Hag Geas. The hag either sneaks a seed into a target\u2019s food or drink, tricks the user into ingesting it, or gets a target to swallow a seed willingly. Either way the effect it has on a target is called a Hag Geas. The hag gease is often used as part of a bargain or deal, in which the target must willingly agree or the hag refuses to deal at all. Hag Geas A willing target of a hag geas has an increased saving throw DC and increased penalties for acting against the geas. An unwilling victim will be able to resist the geas a little easier. Because of this, hags go out of her way to talk a creature into accepting the hag geas willingly. Any sentient creature under a hag geas is affected as if they are under a 6th-level geas spell. The spell DC will be the spell DC of the hag\u2019s spells or special abilities. If the target willingly accepts the hag geas then add +4 to the spell DC. A willing target of a hag geas is also vulnerable to psychic damage when the source is hag geas. Remove curse and dispel magic will not work against a hag geas but a wish spell will. Someone attempting to remove a hag geas with a greater restoration will succeed only if the caster also wins a Charisma contest against the hag who placed the hag geas on the victim. The spell automatically succeeds if the caster and the hag are on different planes of existence. Transmute to Poison. The hag can place a seed into any container of liquid and poison its contents. Transmute to poison is more effective against unenchanted liquids, such as water, holy water, acids, beer, etc. This transmutation is instantaneous and does not change the color, smell, or taste of the liquid. This effect turns liquids into the poison, swan\u2019s lament. Potions affected by transmute to poison become potions of poison. Poison - Swan\u2019s Lament (Ingest) This poison can only be created by a hag with a seed satchel. Against any creature that is not a swan or a swanmay, this poison causes 28 (8d6) poison damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Those that fail their saving throw also gain the poisoned condition for 4 (1d6 + 1) hours. Against a swan or a swanmay this poison is very virulent and dangerous. Swans will automatically die if this poison is drunk. Swanmays face a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or they lose 2d4 points of Constitution. While under this effect they will have dreams of drinking blood with the certain knowledge that doing so will cure them. The Swanmay then faces a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or she is compelled to find the nearest humanoid and drain and drink its blood. If they do this then they forever lose the ability to assume the form of a swan, but they are no longer poisoned and their Constitution is restored to normal. Call Treant. The hag buries a seed near her lair and within 2d6 days a treant arrives, not under any magic control or compulsion, but very suspicious of the hag. The hag and the treant will then start a long conversation. Over the course of the next few days the treant and the hag will discuss nature, the weather, and any nearby threats to the wilderness. The hag will be on her best behaviour and will have the truly hideous objects and minions well hidden. She will slowly try and tempt the treant into a partnership of sorts, playing to its anger of fire and encroaching civilization. In game terms this translates into a week long Wisdom ability contest, where the hag has advantage if there has been any recent (within the last 10 years) wilderness incursions by civilization, monster hordes, etc. The treant will have advantage on the Wisdom contest if something not of the wilderness or natural world has acted recently to defend the forest or the creatures within it. If the treant wins the contest it ambles away and the two part on neutral terms. If the hag wins the Wisdom contest then she can turn the willing treant into a vengeful treant who volunteers to storm into civilization and wreak havoc or defend the nearby wilderness violently and without quarter. Transmute Treant to Vengeful Treant. A willing treant will accept a seed and allow it to take root somewhere on its body if successfully talked into this transformation by a hag. This ritual transforms the treant slowly over the course of 3d4 days. This vengeful treant is not magically compelled by the hag but its mind has been corrupted by her presence and rituals, which changes the treant\u2019s statistics and its alignment to chaotic neutral. All or Nothing. A Hag who is facing overwhelming odds and is willing to completely destroy her seed satchel can use all the seeds she has remaining (no less than 3) for a last ditch effort to destroy the general area and escape with her life. In order to do this she must, as an action, violently empty the contents of her satchel and toss the satchel into the air, where it will burst into flames. On the hag\u2019s next turn she levitates, per spell, but with the ability to move horizontally if she choses. Her location at the start of this same round is also the center of an earthquake spell. The hag can take no action while maintaining the earthquake effects other than levitating 60 feet either vertically or horizontally. A hag can maintain the earthquake for a number of rounds equal to twice her Charisma modifier (minimum of 2 rounds). If she does anything other than levitate then both the levitation and earthquake spell ends immediately.",

This phenomenon aggressively pursues any living creature within 60 feet of the crate for 3 rounds. The trap resets on the next round, and the PCs must either disable it before further manipulating the crate\u2019s locking mechanisms (DC 25 Dexterity check with thieves\u2019 tools) or avoid triggering it by moving the parts in the correct order. The trap can be detected and disabled with successful Intelligence (Arcana) checks (DC 20 for both), or with a successful dispel magic ability check against DC 16. Solving the puzzle box requires a DC 25 Dexterity check with thieves\u2019 tools. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check before the attempt grants advantage on the Dexterity check. Other PCs can attempt this Intelligence check by using the Help action, even if they are otherwise unable to open the lock on their own. In addition, several clicks, whirs, and pops emanate from the box\u2019s interior as the PCs manipulate the mechanisms. If the PCs listen closely to these sounds and succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, the audible clues reduce the DC of the Dexterity check by 5. @font-face {font-family:\"MS Mincho\"; panose-1:2 2 6 9 4 2 5 8 3 4; mso-font-alt:\"\uff2d\uff33 \u660e\u671d\"; mso-font-charset:128; mso-generic-font-family:modern; mso-font-pitch:fixed; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1791491579 134217746 0 131231 0;}@font-face {font-family:\"Cambria Math\"; panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:roman; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;}@font-face {font-family:Verdana; panose-1:2 11 6 4 3 5 4 4 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:swiss; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-1593833729 1073750107 16 0 415 0;}@font-face {font-family:Cambria; panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:roman; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536869121 1107305727 33554432 0 415 0;}@font-face {font-family:\"\\@MS Mincho\"; panose-1:2 2 6 9 4 2 5 8 3 4; mso-font-charset:128; mso-generic-font-family:modern; mso-font-pitch:fixed; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1791491579 134217746 0 131231 0;}p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal {mso-style-unhide:no; mso-style-qformat:yes; mso-style-parent:\"\"; margin:0cm; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif; mso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; mso-ansi-language:EN-GB;}p.BodyCopyIndent, li.BodyCopyIndent, div.BodyCopyIndent {mso-style-name:\"Body Copy Indent\"; mso-style-unhide:no; mso-style-qformat:yes; mso-style-link:\"Body Copy Indent Char\"; margin:0cm; text-indent:9.0pt; line-height:12.0pt; mso-pagination:none; mso-layout-grid-align:none; text-autospace:none; font-size:8.0pt; font-family:\"Verdana\",sans-serif; mso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; color:black; mso-ansi-language:EN-GB;}span.BodyCopyIndentChar {mso-style-name:\"Body Copy Indent Char\"; mso-style-unhide:no; mso-style-qformat:yes; mso-style-locked:yes; mso-style-parent:\"\"; mso-style-link:\"Body Copy Indent\"; mso-ansi-font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt; font-family:\"Verdana\",sans-serif; mso-ascii-font-family:Verdana; mso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; mso-hansi-font-family:Verdana; color:black; mso-ansi-language:EN-GB;}.MsoChpDefault {mso-style-type:export-only; mso-default-props:yes; font-size:10.0pt; mso-ansi-font-size:10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt; font-family:\"Cambria\",serif; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-fareast-font-family:\"MS Mincho\"; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; mso-font-kerning:0pt; mso-ligatures:none;}div.WordSection1 {page:WordSection1;}",

    "name": "Thought Bottle",
    "description": "Thought Bottle Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) This flask is made of thick green glass and always appears empty inside. It can be used to store knowledge, memories, and even spells. While attuned to the bottle and holding it, you can store a bit of knowledge, memory, or spell in it. Storing a piece of knowledge requires an action, storing a spell requires you to cast the spell (the spell has no effect other than to be stored in the bottle when cast this way), and storing a memory requires an amount of time equal to the memory\u2019s duration. While attuned to the bottle, you can touch it and use an action to speak a command word. Doing so allows you to determine the general contents contained within the bottle, but doesn\u2019t provide access to specific knowledge, memories, or spells stored inside. In order to access a bottle\u2019s contents, you must use an action while holding the bottle to enter a state of deep concentration (as though concentrating on a spell). While in this state, you are incapacitated and can\u2019t move. You also automatically fail Dexterity saving throws. If you remain in this state until the end of your next turn, you recover one whole thought, memory, or spell stored within the bottle. Knowledge. Knowledge can include an idea or conclusion, such as a particular course of action or the answer to a problem or the name of a murderer, as well as passphrases and command words for magic items and effects. A piece of knowledge must be able to be phrased in a single sentence of 25 words or less. When you store knowledge in the bottle, it disappears from your mind, but you know the general contents of what you stored. Memories. One memory counts as your entire recollection of events lasting up to a single day. When you store a memory into the bottle, it disappears from your mind, but you know the general contents of what you stored (for example, \u201cthe night I first ventured into Dagult Neverember\u2019s vault under the city of Waterdeep\u201d). Spells. When you retrieve a spell, you know the spell, it doesn\u2019t count against the number of spells you know or can prepare, and you can cast it using a spell slot as normal. Once you cast a spell retrieved from the bottle, you lose memory of it unless you can retrieve the same spell again or know it by some other means. The bottle can hold up to 12 thoughts worth of content. One thought is equivalent to a single piece of knowledge or up to 6 hours of continuous memory. Spells are more complex and each spell stored in the bottle takes up 3 thoughts worth of space per spell level. If your attunement to the bottle ends, the contents of the bottle are lost unless a wish spell or similar magic is used.",
