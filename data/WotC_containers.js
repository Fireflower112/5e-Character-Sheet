Reaching inside the bag, however, reveals the presence of a small, fuzzy object. The bag weighs 1/2 pound. You can use an action to pull the fuzzy object from the bag and throw it up to 20 feet. When the object lands, it transforms into a creature you determine by rolling a d8 and consulting the table that corresponds to the bag's color. The creature vanishes at the next dawn or when it is reduced to 0 hit points . The creature is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts on your turn . You can use a bonus action to command how the creature moves and what action it takes on its next turn, or to give it general orders, such as to attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature. Once three fuzzy objects have been pulled from the bag, the bag can't be used again until the next dawn.

Ending it early doesn\u2019t give you the benefit of exhaling the breath. Elemental Magic Items Elemental power has allowed the cults to have more magic items than is normal for groups of their size, yet there still aren\u2019t enough magic items for each cultist to have one. Every member of the air cult, for example, would love to be able to soar on the wind, but only certain members have a magical ability or an item that confers that blessing. The cults have some special items that harness the power of the elemental nodes themselves. These items rely on energy siphoned from a node, and some of them must be recharged inside the appropriate type of node, as noted in the items\u2019 descriptions. Otherwise, such an item ceases to function. Adventurers who recover a node-fueled item will, therefore, only be able to recharge it when an appropriate node is nearby.",

A creature trapped in the flask doesn\u2019t age and doesn\u2019t need to breathe, eat, or drink. You can take a Magic action to remove the flask\u2019s stopper and release the creature in the flask. The creature then obeys your commands for 1 hour, understanding those commands even if it doesn\u2019t know the language in which the commands are given. If you issue no commands or give the creature a command that is likely to result in its death or imprisonment, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. At the end of the duration, the creature acts in accordance with its normal disposition and alignment. An Identify spell reveals if the flask contains a creature, but the only way to determine the type of creature is to open the flask. A newly discovered Iron Flask might already contain a creature chosen by the DM or determined randomly by rolling on the following table (see the Monster Manual for the creature\u2019s stat block). 1d100 Contents 01\u201350 No creature 51 Arcanaloth 52\u201354 Bone Devil 55\u201356 Cambion 57\u201358 Dao 59 Deva 60\u201361 Djinni 62\u201363 Efreeti 64\u201365 Erinyes 66\u201367 Fomorian 68 Githyanki Knight 69 Githzerai Zerth 70\u201371 Glabrezu 72\u201374 Hezrou 75 Incubus 76\u201377 Invisible Stalker 78\u201379 Marid 80 Marilith 81\u201382 Mezzoloth 83\u201384 Nalfeshnee 85\u201386 Night Hag 87\u201388 Nycaloth 89 Planetar 90\u201391 Red Slaad 92\u201393 Salamander 94 Solar 95 Succubus 96 Ultroloth 97\u201399 Vrock 00 Xorn",

You can take a Magic action to pull the fuzzy object from the bag and throw it up to 20 feet. When the object lands, it transforms into a creature you determine by rolling on the table that corresponds to the bag\u2019s color. See the Monster Manual for the creature\u2019s stat block. The creature vanishes at the next dawn or when it is reduced to 0 Hit Points. The creature is Friendly to you and your allies, and it acts immediately after you on your Initiative count. You can take a Bonus Action to command how the creature moves and what action it takes on its next turn, such as attacking an enemy. In the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature. Once three fuzzy objects have been pulled from the bag, the bag can\u2019t be used again until the next dawn.
